# Image denoising using Residual block architecture

**#Training models**
Here, first we trained the model using radial crop technique i.e.denoising1model.h5 file. Further we applied fine tuning technique to train the model i.e. , which is our final trained model.
#Testing part
Our model has a 'main.py' file which basically takes noise images as input with'/test/low' and predicts the corresponding denoised images as per our model to path'/test/predicted'.
#Report
The attached report clearly explains every part of code and what it does.
#Conclusion
Our major criteria in this project was PSNR score which was evaluated as the benchmark.For our model we found a PSNR score of .
