# Image Denoising using Residual Block Architecture

## Training Models
Here, first we trained the model using the radial crop technique, resulting in the `denoising1model.h5` file. Further, we applied a fine-tuning technique to train the model, which is our final trained model.

## Testing Part
Our model has a `main.py` file which takes noisy images as input from the `/test/low` directory and predicts the corresponding denoised images, saving them to the `/test/predicted` directory.

## Report
The attached report clearly explains every part of the code and its functionality.

## Conclusion
Our major criterion in this project was the PSNR score, which was evaluated as the benchmark. For our model, we found a PSNR score of .
